# Intro to HTML & CSS

## Tasks: 

1. Setup the base of your project by "scaffolding" your index.html file (!DOCTYPE, html, head, body). 
2. Add a "title" tag in the head, and give your site a title!
3. Link your CSS to your index.html file. This link tag will be directly beneath the title tag and should look like this: ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">```
4. Begin adding some content using different html tags - think of what sites you like, and think about the content it has(content being the key word, not the styling!). A large heading, a subheading, some content, maybe a picture and/or a list? 
5. Now it's time for our styling. Check out the style.css file.
6. Start experimenting with different css declarations (css property value pairs) on your different html tags, and see what you can do with them. 
7. Try and modify font size, font color, background color,  text alignment, etc.
